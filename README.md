# Lab4 Biometrics
```
---> Biometric authentication is one of the best ways to authenticate users, as
it requires the person wanting to authenticate to be there and provide any of
their many biometrics, such as: Fingerprints, face, iris, and many more biological
features that can be scanned and used to make sure he or she is the correct
person authenticating to the service.

---> For this lab, we are going to be writing a python program that will
perform fingerprint image processing and feature extraction. This will be
achieved by following the steps below:

-> Create 3 methods for image classification

-> Test all 3 of these methods and record the minimum, maximum and
average False Rejection (FRR) and False Acceptance Rates (FAR), and the
Equal Error Rate (EER).

-> Create a hybrid method that uses all 3 previous methods and gets the
majority decision to get a better EER.

-> Run the hybrid method and record the min, max, avg for FRR and FAR,
and the new EER value.
```
